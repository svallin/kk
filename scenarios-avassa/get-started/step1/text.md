The first thing we will do is to install the command line tool `supctl`.
In the Control Tower UI:

1. click the user icon top right and select resources
2. select install supctl
3. copy and close that window

Now paste that command in your shell.

Validate that you can run Avassa commands by trying:

```plain
./supctl profile show
```{{exec}}
